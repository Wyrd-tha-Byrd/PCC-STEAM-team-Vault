# Machine Anatomy

	- Y
		- Horizontal
	- Z
		- Vertical
	- E
		- Extruder
- Linear Rods
	- Round Rods that are used as a sliding/rolling axis.
	- Machined within a tight spec, straightened and hardened
- Screw Rods
	- Rods that are used for a motor driven axis as a translation of power
	- Machined within reasonable tolerance, straightened, hardened and tempered 
- Linear Rails
	- Rectangular Flat Bars that usually have a pre-mounted bearing slide
	- Machined with incredibly low tolerances, hardened and tempered
- Belt Drive
	- Drive mechanisms using a soft rubber, cloth, leather, or other non-elastic belting material
- Gantry
	- The name of the carriage that carries and allows constrained movement for the Extruder through the build volume
- Hot Bed
	- Not necessarily 
- Environment Sensors
	- Hygrometer
		- Environmental Humidity
	- Thermometer
		- Environmental Temperature
- #### Extruder Assembly
	- Bowden Tube vs Direct Drive
		- Bowden Tube
			- Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE for short, also known by a brand name; Teflon)
				- Low friction
				- allows extruder to be separate from extruder head
				- can be used to create an airtight path from dry box to printer
		- Direct Drive
			- Friction Drive
				- two smooth pulley-like gears work together to push filament out of the nozzle
			- Single Gear
				- A single gear and a friction gear work together to get slightly more grip on hard plastics
			- Dual Gear
				- Two gears turn in unison creating a pinch point that forces the filament through the nozzle
				- can increase "pressure advance" and help with stubborn filaments
				- can lead to filament shredding if the nozzle becomes clogged for some reason
			- Belt Drive
				- Mostly used for low Shore A Thermoplastic Polyurethane and other flexible/soft plastics
				- uses small belts to propel the filament forward while controlling for undesirable vectors of force
				- works as a hybrid of friction and single gear driven extruders
	- #### Idler Assembly
		- Idler Gear
			- Idler Tensioner
			- Single vs Dual Gear vs Belt Drive
	- #### Filament Runout Sensor
	- #### Bed Level Sensors
		- Electromagnetic Probe
		- Impedance
		- Microswitch Probe
	- #### Hot End Assembly
		- Nozzle
			- Generally Brass and 0.4mm however specialty nozzles can be used to great effect if you know what to use them for
			- comes in sizes ranging from 0.10mm - 1.5mm
		- Heat Break
			- Small tube that connects the heater block to the heat sink
			- prevents heat creep (unmanageable amount of material melting)
		- Heat Sink
			- Hot End Cooling Fan
		- Heater Block
			- Temperature Sensor
				- Thermistor
				- Thermocouple
			- Temperature Effector
				- Heater Core
	- Limit Switch (Microswitch with frame mount)
- #### Build Plates
	- Surfaces
		- Bare Base
			- Smoothest option
		- Diffraction Grating
			- Leaves a Holographic surface on the printed object first layer
		- Textured PEI (Sticker)
			- Leaves a textured surface
			- has best adhesion for most printable materials
		- Smooth PEI (Powder Coated)
			- consistently rough surface for better adhesion than glass
		- Garolite
			- Expensive
			- high quality smooth surface
			- best for nylon and other engineering filaments
		- Adhesive Mask
			- Cheap but inconsistent texture
			- has to be refreshed before each print (good rule of thumb, not required)
			- can be multiple different things but the most common are
				- Blue Painter's Tape (can get expensive but is reusable if you're extra careful, adhesive comes off with alcohol and scrubbing)
				- Purple Elmer's Glue stick (good for about 2-3 prints, water soluble, cheapest)
				- Bed Weld (each application is good for about 25 prints, thermosensitive adhesive, releases when cold, also water soluble)
	- Base
		- Glass
			- Perfectly smooth
			- unbendable
			- susceptible to cold shock
			- CAN use a metal scraper
		- Spring Steel Sheet
			- Bendable
			- Can be smooth or textured
			- Excellent thermal transmission
			- Nearly indestructible
			- Magnetic
			- DO NOT SCRAPE WITH METAL TOOLS
- Frame
	- Types
		- Cartesian
			- Most Common Nowadays
			- Uses Cartesian Coordinates (cubic grid with no rotation)
			- Square Build area
			- Consistent Accuracy but potential for mesh triangulation artifacts
		- Polar
			- Used for Radial Manufacturing Prototyping
			- Uses Quaternion Coordinates (Cubic grid with rotation relative to the origin or reference frame)
			- Circular Build area
			- More Accurate towards Center
		- Delta
			- Hybrid of Polar and Cartesian, instead of using quaternions, it uses Cartesian Coordinates on without the mesh artifacts found on Cartesian Printers
			- Circular Build Area
			- Generally the tallest in relation to their base plate, thus making them a great use of workshop real estate
		- Robotic Arm
			- Only as accurate as the play in the mechatronics
			- Minimum Resolution may be affected however build volume is all reachable space
			- Uses Absolute Quaternion Space 
			- Toroidal Build Volume
		- Hybrid
			- More and more printers are being made every day and the types are as endless as human creativity. You can help by adding to this list.
	- Materials
		- T-slot Extrusion (Aluminum)
			- Modular
		- Purpose built
			- Self Printed
				- RepRap/Voron styles
					- Still using rails/rods but doesn't use OEM Connectors
			- CNC Milled
				- Aluminum
					- Lightweight
				- Steel
					- Steady
				- Polycarbonate Plates
					- Chemical resistant
					- Lightweight
		- Linear Rails & Rods
			- Expensive and creates several points for failure.
			- smoothest and fastest gantry mount
- Mainboard/Motherboard
	- Determines the versions and options available for firmware settings
	- Job Manager (Optional Server)
		- This is a second computer collecting and sending information, essentially taking the compute load off of the 3d printer's mainboard
- Power Supply Unit
	- This is the only reason anything turns on
- Display
	- Selector Encoder
		- The knob on the front of the machine that allows you to navigate printer settings
	- Action Cancel Button
		- Cancels ANY current operation, use with caution
	- Screen
		- Displays all the information that the printer holds by itself, if you want more details, you can set up a klipper (+ MoonsailOS) instance
